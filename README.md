# Mark Donahue's Online Portfolio
Hello! Thanks for stopping by to check out my online resume. This is a project I began working on in December 2022, with the aim of improving and expanding the website to host the multiple projects I have completed throughout my journey to becoming a full stack web developer. Feel free to have a look around!
